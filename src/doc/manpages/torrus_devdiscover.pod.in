=head1 NAME

devdiscover - Performs SNMP discovery and generates Torrus XML
configuration file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<torrus devdiscover> [--in=I<XMLFILE>] [I<options...>] [I<XMLFILES>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<devdiscover> performs SNMP discovery using the I<XMLFILE>
for the discovery instructions. It generates a corresponding
Torrus XML configuration file. See B<Torrus SNMP Discovery User Guide> for
details.

The generic input file, or device discovery XML (DDX), may be generated 
by the B<genddx> utility, and then edited and maintained manually.
Multiple input files may be specified by several instances of I<--in>
option, or simply as arguments.

Input file name is searched in the current directory, and then in
F<@sitedir@/discovery/>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--mkdir>

Creates C<data-dir> directories.

=item B<--limit>=I<REGEXP>

Limits the discovery to the output files matching the regular expression
I<REGEXP>. If multiple B<--limit> options are given, the output file
must match at least one of them to be processed. Bundle files will be
written if all their member XML files are available.

=item B<--forcebundle>

With this option enabled, C<devdiscover> will write the bundle
file even if some of the bundle members were not created because of errors.

=item B<--fallback>=I<INTEGER>

Requires B<--forcebundle>. In case if an SNMP device is not available,
the bundle file will include an older version of the XML output file,
provided that it exists and it is not older than the specified number of days.

=item B<--threads>=I<INTEGER>

If the threads are enabled in the local Perl, this option determines
how many parallel discovery threads are to be executed.
The discovery jobs are distributed per output files, thus it makes
sence to use threads only when there are many output files defined in
a single DDX file.


=item B<--verbose>

Prints extra information.

=item B<--debug>

Prints debugging information.

=item B<--snmpdebug>

Prints SNMP protocol details
