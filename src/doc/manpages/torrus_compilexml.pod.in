=head1 NAME

compilexml - Torrus XML configuration (re)compiler.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<torrus compilexml> --tree=I<TREENAME> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command compiles the Torrus's XML configuration for the tree
I<TREENAME>. It does not require any other processes to be restarted
after the configuration is changed. The compiler processes the XML files
in an incremental way: only the changes are processed.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--all>

Instructs to compile configuration for all trees.

=item B<--noval>

Disables all validation of the XML configuration. This speeds up the
compilation up to 2 times, while adding a risk to end up with an
unusable configuration. In addition, the first initialization cycle of
Collector and Monitor in this case would be much longer.

=item B<--force>

Normally the compiler looks for changes in XML files, and only processes
the ones that differ from previous run. With force option, the compiler
will consider all XML files as new, and process the whole configuration
from scratch.

=item B<--nogc>

Normally the Git garbage collector is launched after the compilation is
complete. This option makes the compiler skip the GC run. This can be
useful if multiple compiler processes are started in parallel for
different trees.

=item B<--debug>

Sets the log level to debug.

=item B<--verbose>

Sets the debug level to info.

=item B<--help>

Displays a help message.
